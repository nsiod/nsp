//! Control-center poller (reverse API).
//!
//! Periodically pulls a snapshot from a remote control plane and
//! reconciles it into the local SQLite database + iptables. The
//! control center is the source of truth for membership; nsp is the
//! data plane that converges to whatever the control center says.
//! Pull semantics keep the deployment behind NAT firewall friendly:
//! the control center never has to reach into nsp.
//!
//! The HTTP client is `reqwest` with rustls + ring (matching the rest
//! of the binary). Failures during fetch or reconcile are logged and
//! the loop sleeps until the next tick.
//!
//! ## Snapshot shape
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "cursor":   "v42",          // opaque cursor; persisted, sent as ?since
//!   "reset":    false,          // wipe the local cursor before applying
//!   "mode":     "merge",        // "merge" (default) or "replace"
//!   "settings": { ... },        // optional patch over the singleton row
//!   "users":    [ ... ]         // Full users list; OR
//!   "users":    {               // Delta users
//!       "upsert": [ ... ],
//!       "delete": [ ... ]
//!   },
//!   "iptables": [ ... ]         // declarative full set of control-source rules
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## User sync modes
//!
//! Two `users` shapes are accepted (`serde(untagged)` selects):
//!
//! * **Full** — `users: [...]`. Used on first sync, when the server
//!   has no cursor state, or when the supplied cursor is too old.
//!   * Users matched by `id`. Missing rows inserted; existing rows
//!     have their `name` / `note` updated when they differ.
//!   * Deletion of local users not in the snapshot is gated by the
//!     `ConflictPolicy` switch — see *Conflict policy* below.
//!
//! * **Delta** — `users: { upsert, delete }`. The server states
//!   exactly what changed since the cursor we sent. Upserts
//!   create-or-update by `id`; deletes always remove (server is
//!   authoritative for deletes in delta mode — `ConflictPolicy` and
//!   `mode: "replace"` are irrelevant).
//!
//! ## Iptables
//!
//! `iptables`, when present in the snapshot, is the complete intended
//! set of rules owned by `Source::Control`. Rules from other sources
//! (`User`, `WgDriver`) are never touched.
//!
//! Inserts and content matches are unconditional; whether to delete
//! existing control-source rules absent from the snapshot is driven
//! by `ConflictPolicy` — same switch as users.
//!
//! ## Conflict policy
//!
//! `NSP_CONTROL_CONFLICT_POLICY` (operator-side) governs what happens
//! to local resources that the server didn't include in a Full
//! snapshot — uniformly across users AND control-source iptables:
//!
//! * `keep` (default) — additive merge. Local extras stay. Pre-seed
//!   resources locally and the control center won't delete them.
//! * `prune` — authoritative. Local extras are deleted. Equivalent
//!   to the server having sent `mode: "replace"` on every Full
//!   snapshot.
//!
//! `mode: "replace"` (server-side, per response) always wins: even
//! with policy=keep, a single response can request a hard alignment.
//!
//! ## Cursor + reset
//!
//! The server's authoritative cursor is persisted in `server_config`
//! and sent back as `?since={cursor}` on the next request. Servers
//! that ignore `since` simply keep returning Full payloads; the
//! protocol degrades gracefully.
//!
//! `reset: true` immediately wipes the persisted cursor before
//! anything else is applied. Combined with the new `cursor` field in
//! the same response this lets the server force a clean re-sync —
//! "drop your state, here is the fresh starting point."
